                <p>Watching an Australian Shepherd round up a flock of sheep is a beautiful sight. With sure and athletic movement, he directs the flock using nips, barks, and "eye," a penetrating stare that clearly says, "I'm in charge."

<b>Intelligent, hard working, and versatile,</b> the Aussie is a no-nonsense dog who thrives in a home where his brains and energy are put to good use. You don't have to keep a flock of sheep if you live with an Aussie — although it doesn't hurt — but you do have to keep him busy. He's a high-energy dog who doesn't know the meaning of couch potato and wouldn't approve of it if he did.</p>

                <p>You can even teach an Aussie to help you with chores around the house, such as picking up dirty laundry off the floor and bringing it to you. You'll probably have to fold clean laundry yourself, though.</p>

                <p>The Aussie's a real looker who stands out from the crowd thanks to his attractive medium-length coat and dark brown, yellow, blue, green, or amber eyes.

His heritage as a working dog makes him a loyal companion who can be protective of home and family and aloof with strangers. He gets along with kids, although he'll probably try to "herd" them unless you teach him not to.

The Aussie makes life an adventure. He'll work and play from sunrise to sunset and win your heart with his loyal and loving personality. This versatile breed is a wonderful working dog and a terrific family companion — but only if that family is an active one.</p>
                
                <h4>Breed Has Variety of Colors</h4>

                <p>Australian Shepherds are <b>herding dogs</b> and many consider kids part of their "flock," so you'll need to teach your Aussie that chasing and nipping at kids to herd them isn't allowed. Once they learn this lesson, Aussies make wonderful companions for families with kids.

Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.</p>

                <div>Is an Aussie the Right Dog For Me?</div>

                <p>This herding dog's pushiness with livestock can carry over into the home and, with a timid or inexperienced owner, he may assume the dominant role in the family. The breed needs a firm and confident owner — <strong>Aussies probably aren't a good choice if you've never had a dog before.</strong></p>

                <p>Aussies enjoy the company of their family and prefer to stick close to their human pack. They don't do well stuck in the backyard by themselves for long periods.</p>

                    <h6><ul>One of the Most loyal dogs in the dog world</ul></h6>
                <p>Aussies are by nature standoffish with people they don't know, and unless they have regular exposure to lots of different people — ideally beginning in puppyhood — they can become fearful of strangers. This may lead to biting out of fear and aggression. Give your Aussie lots of contact with friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers to help him polish his social skills.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.</p>
